• Quantum gravity: Einstein's general relativity + quantum mechanics  
• Higher-dimensional: (d+1)-dimensional AdS space
• Metric: ds² = (L²/z²)(dz² + η_μν dx^μ dx^ν)

• Holographic principle: Information on boundary encodes bulk physics
• AdS/CFT dictionary: Maps bulk fields to boundary operators
• Remarkable: Strong/weak coupling duality

• Hyperbolic neural networks preserving AdS geometry
• Physics-informed constraints ensuring theoretical consistency
